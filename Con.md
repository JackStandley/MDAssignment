# 1. Creativity
AI has proved to be one of the most interesting advancements in human history. However, as of now, it can only do what it is programed to do. This is prominent in creativity in the workplace. AI cannot create new or original ideas for things such as new ways to solve problems or the plot for a new movie. 


# 2. Reduced Jobs for humans
With AI being so good at what it does, it is a no brainer for any businessman to pay a human to do a job that a computer can do ten times better and faster. This will eventually put a lot of people out of work.



# 3. The Probable APOCOLYPSE!!!!
If AI keeps advancing at the rate it is now, it will end up in the wrong hands at some point. Also the probability of us creating AI robots that serve us is highly likely. If you have seen any movie ever then you know that this never ends well.
